# Roll the Dice
The Dice game is a game in which two players participate and when the dice are rolled, the web page tells the players "the winner" If the number on any of the dice is greater than the number on the other die, it will tell the players "Draw" if the number on both dice are the same. The game is played just by reloading the web page.
